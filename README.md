# gep-rules
## Project
This is simple implementation of Gene Expression Programming machine-learning algorithm as proposed by Dr. Cândida Ferreira.

[C. Ferreira, “Gene expression programming : mathematical modeling by an artificial intelligence,” p. 478, 2006.*](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540327967)

Work in the project is aimed at ensuring very good performance (speed) of the algorithm.

The ultimate goal is to implement complete framework for fast fuzzy rules generation using GEP as a follow up on:

## Usage

- Configure data and algorithm paremeters in *setup.py* file.
- Optionally use *scenarios.py* to prepare new experiments.
- Execute experiments running *experiments.py* file.
